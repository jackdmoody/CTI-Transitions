# Progress

## 2026-10-24: environment setup
- Done: DRIFT pinned as the submodule `third_party/DRIFT` @ `brims-2026` (`3517424`). `ctit/adapters/drift.py` loads it and checks the pin. Conda env `w2` (Python 3.12.15) has DRIFT's `requirements.txt` installed. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is loaded from `.env` (`ctit/env.py`); the API smoke test succeeded.

## 2026-10-24: planning + WP1 (in progress)
- Plan approved: `docs/WORKPLAN.md`. Spec §2.5/§3/§4/§5/§7 updated: mean log-LR per transition, extended Sigma mapper, `qwen3:14b`. SPEC_ISSUES has 4 entries.
- WP1 code done: run contract (`ctit/run.py`, `ctit/calls.py`), adapter API (`ingest_raw_sysmon`, `ingest_tagged`, `save_tagged`, `apply_role_overrides`, `run_brims_transition`), `configs/drift_parity.yaml`, `tests/test_drift_parity.py`.
- Passed: 13 tests, including adapter ≡ DRIFT's `run_strata.py` on a synthetic parquet (peer JSD to 1e-6, identical vectors).
- **Not yet passed (WP1 acceptance):** the 3 BRiMS parity tests skip, because the BRiMS raw Sysmon parquet isn't on this machine. Needed: its path, set as `brims_parquet` in `configs/drift_parity.yaml` or via `CTIT_BRIMS_PARQUET`. Then run `pytest tests/test_drift_parity.py`; the first run tokenizes 6.8M rows and caches to `data/cache/`.
- Open: DPRK plan check and OTRF availability check (Jack, by hand; record results here). Choice of size-curve model pending (proposed `qwen3:4b`). Ollama not installed yet.
- Next: finish WP1 once the parquet is available; then WP3.
