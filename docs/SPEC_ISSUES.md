## 2026-10-24: DRIFT dependency mechanism (§8), resolved by Jack

**Issue.** §8 said to depend on DRIFT as `drift @ git+...@brims-2026` in `pyproject.toml`. DRIFT has no package metadata (no `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`). Its code is `scripts/pipeline_drivers/sysmon_pipeline/` plus an `observational` package shipped as `observational.tar.gz`, so it can't be pip-installed from the tag.

**Decision (Jack).** Pin DRIFT as the git submodule `third_party/DRIFT` at `brims-2026` (`3517424`). `ctit/adapters/drift.py` adds DRIFT's packages to `sys.path`, extracting the tarball to the gitignored `.cache/drift/`, and verifies the submodule HEAD and a clean tree. The allowance to add a `pyproject.toml` to DRIFT is removed, and DRIFT is never modified. §8 and CLAUDE.md are updated to match.
